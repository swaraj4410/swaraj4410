## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate learner with a deep interest in computer science. I hold a master's degree in computer science from Kumaun University and am currently diving into the world of generative AI. I also hold various certifications from Udacity and Coursera in AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). My journey spans traditional computer science domains, with a focus on machine learning, deep learning, and cybersecurity. I believe the current wave of AI is the future and can equip us to make the world a better place.
